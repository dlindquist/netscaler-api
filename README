EXAMPLE

   Pass any kwargs to init that you would to the suds.client.Client constructor.
   A little bit of magic is performed with the ImportDoctor to cover missing
   types used in the WSDL.

        * If you specify wsdl, this file will be pulled from the default http URL
        * If you specify wsdl_url, it will override the wsdl file. Local
         "file://" URLs work just fine.

   To save time for re-usable code, it is a good idea subclassing this to
   create methods for commonly used commands in your application. Example:

        class MyAPI(API):
            def __init__(self, **kwargs):
                API.__init__(self, **kwargs)

            def change_password(self, username, newpass):
                return self.run("setsystemuser_password", 
                    **dict(username=username, password=newpass))

   In a script:

        import netscaler

        if __name__ == '__main__':
            netscaler.DEBUG = True
            wsdl_url = 'file:///home/j/jathan/sandbox/NSUserAdmin.wsdl'
            client = netscaler.API('nos', username='nsroot', password='nsroot', wsdl_url=wsdl_url)
            print client.logged_in
